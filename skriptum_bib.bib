@article{Feilhauer2020a,
abstract = {The efficient transfer of excitations between different levels of a quantum system is a task with many applications. Among the various protocols to carry out such a state transfer in driven systems, rapid adiabatic passage (RAP) is one of the most widely used. Here we show both theoretically and experimentally that adding a suitable amount of loss to the driven Hamiltonian turns a RAP protocol into a scheme for encircling an exceptional point including the chiral state transfer associated with it. Our work thus discloses an intimate connection between a whole body of literature on RAP and recent studies on the dynamics in the vicinity of an exceptional point, which we expect to serve as a bridge between the disjoint communities working on these two scenarios.},

@article{Mehri-Dehnavi2008a,
abstract = {For an arbitrary possibly non-Hermitian matrix Hamiltonian H that might involve exceptional points, we construct an appropriate parameter space M and line bundle Ln over M such that the adiabatic geometric phases associated with the eigenstates of the initial Hamiltonian coincide with the holonomies of Ln. We examine the case of 2×2 matrix Hamiltonians in detail and show that, contrary to claims made in some recent publications, geometric phases arising from encircling exceptional points are generally geometrical and not topological in nature. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},
