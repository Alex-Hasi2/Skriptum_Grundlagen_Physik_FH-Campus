# Copilot instructions for this repository

This repo contains a German physics script (“Skriptum”) written in LaTeX, with chapters split across `chapter_*.tex` files and assembled via `main.tex` / `combined_main*.tex`. There is also a small Python utility in `Code/`.

The repo also contains a second script (“Uebungsbeispiele”) with exercises and solutions. Additionally, there are exams (`test_*.tex`) for students in `Tests/` with their own LaTeX files and the corresponding solutions (`test_*_loesung.tex`).

Only work on the part that the user explicitly requests. If unclear, default to the Skriptum and ask a clarifying question.

## What to optimize for

- Preserve mathematical correctness and established notation.
- Keep diffs minimal and localized to the requested change.
- Prefer fixes that compile cleanly with standard LaTeX tools.
- Avoid stylistic rewrites, reflowing entire paragraphs, or “pretty-printing” unless explicitly requested.

## LaTeX conventions

- Language: German (keep terminology consistent across chapters).
- Do not rename chapter files unless explicitly asked.
- Reuse existing macros and definitions (see `defs.tex`) instead of introducing new ones.
- There are 3 different types of boxes defined in the preamble (`main.tex`), each with a specific color and purpose. Use them consistently:
  - `\begin{importantbox}...\end{importantbox}` (red) for important equations, definitions, or results.
  - `\begin{rememberbox}...\end{rememberbox}` (yellow) for key concepts or formulas to remember or highlighting important information.
  - `\begin{examplebox}...\end{examplebox}` (blue) for exercises or problems.
- Units and numbers: follow the repo’s established `siunitx` usage (commonly `\SI{...}{...}` and `\num{...}`).
- Vectors: use `\ivec{...}` for vectors in equations and text and `\ivecS{...}{...}` for vectors with subscripts, as defined in `defs.tex`.
- Equations: keep consistent variable names and formatting; do not “simplify” existing expressions unless requested. The mathematical level should be appropriate for students in a physics course, so avoid unnecessary complexity, advanced notation or multiple steps in a single equation if it can be reasonably split. 
- References: use `\cref` and keep labels stable; avoid changing labels that are already referenced.
- Figures: use paths under `Bilder/` and keep filenames as-is (case-sensitive behavior can matter on non-Windows systems).
  Prefer creating new figures in TikZ when possible; alternatively generate figures via Python and export as PDF/PNG.
- Bibliography: use `skriptum_bib.bib`; do not add sources unless the user provides them.

## Generated / build artifacts (don’t edit)

The following files are generated by LaTeX builds and should not be edited manually unless the user explicitly asks:

- `*.aux`, `*.toc`, `*.out`, `*.lof`, `*.lot`
- `*.bbl`, `*.blg`
- `*.fdb_latexmk`, `*.fls`

## Literature and sources

- If you are asked to add, review or modify content, you should look up details also in the following sources (in order of preference):
  1. The user’s instructions and any specific references they provide.
  2. The existing content in the repo (for consistency).
  3. Standard physics textbooks or lecture notes covering the relevant topic (e.g. in this folder: `Literatur/`)
  4. Reputable online resources (e.g., university course pages, educational websites).

## Editing guidance (important)

- Don’t change pagination, sectioning, or numbering unless the change requires it.
- Don’t silently change decimal separators or German typography conventions.
- Don’t replace environments/packages without checking for compatibility with existing files.
- When fixing compile errors, prefer the smallest change that resolves the error and doesn’t ripple into other chapters.

## Build / compile (Windows-friendly)

Common entry points:

- `main.tex` (primary)
- `combined_main.tex` or `combined_main_2026-02.tex` (combined builds)

Suggested compile command (if `latexmk` is available):

- `latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error main.tex`

If bibliography is involved, `latexmk` should handle it; otherwise use the repo’s existing `.bbl/.blg` flow.

## Python (`Code/`)

- Keep scripts simple and readable; avoid adding heavy dependencies.
- Use clear function boundaries and docstrings only when they materially help.
- When changing file-combining behavior, ensure chapter order remains stable and deterministic.

## TikZ figures

- Use existing styles and macros for consistency if available.
- Test TikZ code in the standalone file `imageTesting.tex` to ensure it compiles before integrating into the main files.
- Most TikZ figures used in the main file are also present as comments in `imageTesting.tex`, so you can inspect them individually.


## What is still to be done

- An "Abbildungsverzeichnis" (list of figures) is still missing and should be added to the main file if requested. Some figures have been taken from external sources and may require proper attribution or formatting adjustments to fit the style of the script. 


## When unsure

Ask a clarifying question before making broad refactors, especially when:

- A change could affect many chapters/labels.
- Mathematical notation/assumptions are ambiguous.
- The user’s target TeX entry point (main vs combined) is unclear.
